# Fabric-Recognition-using-SVM-and-OpenCV
Given an input image of a fabric ( Cotton or Silk only ) this recognizes if the fabric is a Cotton or a Silk cloth with an accuracy of more than 80%.
This is developed in python.
This uses a supervised learning techinique to recognise cotton or silk fabric. 
OpenCV is used to perform image processing on the input image and based on various parameters the fabric is recognised.

NOTE:
Test images have been included in the repository.
